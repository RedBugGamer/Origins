Gravity:

  +You have the ability to modify Gravity to your advantage
  
  + Weightless
    You can remove gravity from all mobs in a 8 block radius for 20 seconds
    
  -Different Physics engine
    Because Fluids use another physics engine they conflict with your physics engine so you take more lava damage and also take damage from water. You also cant regenerate in fluids
    
  +Flight
    You can creative fly but you have a bar that fills when you dont fly but gets consumed when you fly and you take double damage from projectiles while flying
    
  +Force
    Your physics engine isnt well coded enough to hold 10 full hearts so you lost one heart right after joining the world
    
  +Hacker
    You can hack the matrix to stop all entities in a 8 block radius
    
  -Elytra?
    Lame! You can creative fly. Why do you need elytras?
    
  +No fall damage
    You dont take fall damage because your physics engine doesnt support fall damage
    
  +Punch
    when you hit a mob while flying the mob experiences a little bit from your pysics engine and gets launched
